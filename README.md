# Hash-Algorithms
This was an assignment of our "Computer Networks and Security" course.

The task was the following:

You need to implement the SHA-1 hash algorithm in a method String shaOne(byte[]
data). Write another method to use the shaOne method where you open a file (e.g. input.dat)
into an array of bytes and pass the array to the shaOne method. Finally display the hash value or
the digest.

Implement the same for SHA-2
