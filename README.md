# Hash-Algorithms

SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit hash value known as a message digest â€“ typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long.

This was an assignment of our "Computer Networks and Security" course.

### The Code:

This repo contains implementations of both SHA-1 and SHA-2 algorithms written in python from scratch. It accepts a text file input and prints out the hash value/message digest.
